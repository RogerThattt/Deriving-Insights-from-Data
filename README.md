# Deriving-Insights-from-Data
Information to Actionable Insights

Working with data is about producing knowledge. Whether that knowledge is consumed
by a person or acted on by a machine, our goal as professionals working
with data is to use observations to learn about how the world works. We want to
turn information into insights, and asking the right questions ensures that we’re
creating insights about the right things.

list of things that can be made better with data:
• Answering a factual question
• Telling a story
• Exploring a relationship
• Discovering a pattern
• Making a case for a decision
• Automating a process
• Judging an experiment

the “hard skills” of working with data: 
data cleaning, mathematical modeling, visualization, model or graph interpretation...
What is missing from most conversations is how important the “soft skills” are
for making data useful.
